        <p>Japanese tea culture is strongly associated with Japanese sense of beauty called Wabi-sabi. One of the most famous tea-leading man named Sennori-kyu invented this sense, and this perspective is the base of Japanese beauty for a long time. This sense of beauty originated in Japanese tea culture, and Japanese tea ceremony well explains this sense.</p>
        <h2>What is Wabi-sabi?</h2>
        <h3>Wabi</h3>
        <p>Wabi comes from a word “Wabishii”, which means soundlessness, sadness and insufficiency. The following picture conveys the sense of Wabi.</p>

        <p>The color of sunset, orange,  and the swaying grass in the wind brings mood of autumn. You only see a lake and mountains beyond the lake. The top portion of Mt. Fuji appears above cloud. Imagine yourself seeing this view standing by the edge of the lake. You feel the chill wind and no one is beside you. What you see is quite simple, and simpleness gives you a sense of lack. If you feel insufficiency and somewhat cheerless, that is the feeling of Wabi.</p>
        <h3>Sabi</h3>
        <p>Sabi literally means “rust” and also comes from “Sabishii”, which means loneliness. Sabi is a sense of beauty that objects which experienced an elapse of long time show a unique beauty because time allows the object to be the only one thing in the world. Objects in different environment experience different impacts over time and that difference makes the object special. Below is the example of Sabi.</p>

        <p>This is the picture of the rusted and collapsed boat under blue sky. The bottom part of the boat has been eroded by the water over time, and this erosion makes the boat special. You must be feeling a loneliness and an elapse of a long time. If you find this picture beautiful, that is the sense of beauty “Sabi” suggests.</p>

        <p>The following is the video to help convey the concepts of Wabi-sabi to you.</p>
        <h2>Tea Culture and Wabi-sabi</h2>
        <p>Since the concepts of Wabi-sabi is understood, now take a look at the relationship between Japanese tea culture and Wabi-sabi. The idea of Wabi-sabi is seen in the collection of Japanese literature called Manyo-shu in the 700s. This fact shows that Japanese people have been understanding the sense of Wabi-sabi since a long time ago. With that, there is a man named Sennori-kyu, who brought this sense of beauty to tea ceremonies. He advocated that the people should feel sufficiency even though they are not surrounded by a lot of substances. He aimed to feel happiness in the simple way of living. Therefore, tea ceremony was for celebrities at that time, Sennori-kyu tried to make a tea ceremony simple and the people after him followed his way of making tea by eliminating as many substance as they could.</p>
        <p>The following the picture of Japanese tea ceremony. The number of utensils the people use is minimum, and they do not try to make the ceremony gorgeous.</p>

          <p>Wabi-sabi is one of the important concepts to understand Japanese culture, and by simplifying things and eliminating unnecessary substance, the Japanese people have developed their own sense of beauty in tea culture and Japanese culture itself.</p>
