        <h2>Japanese Sense of Beauty</h2>
          <p>Japanese tea culture is strongly associated with Japanese sense of beauty called Wabi-sabi. One of the most famous tea-leading man named Sennori-kyu invented this sense, and this perspective is the base of Japanese beauty for a long time. This sense of beauty originated in Japanese tea culture, and Japanese tea ceremony well explains this sense.</p>
        <h2>What is Wabi-sabi?</h2>
        <h3>Wabi</h3>
        <p>Wabi comes from a word “Wabishii”, which means soundlessness, sadness and insufficiency. The following picture conveys the sense of Wabi.</p>

        <a href="http://photozou.jp/photo/show/2499746/191294009">Pic</a>
        <p>The color of sunset, orange,  and the swaying grass in the wind brings mood of autumn. You only see a lake and mountains beyond the lake. The top portion of Mt. Fuji appears above cloud. Imagine yourself seeing this view standing by the edge of the lake. You feel the chill wind and no one is beside you. What you see is quite simple, and simpleness gives you a sense of lack. If you feel insufficiency and somewhat cheerless, that is the feeling of Wabi.</p>
        <h3>Sabi</h3>
        <p>Sabi literally means “rust” and also comes from “Sabishii”, which means loneliness. Sabi is a sense of beauty that objects which experienced an elapse of long time show a unique beauty because time allows the object to be the only one thing in the world. Objects in different environment experience different impacts over time and that difference makes the object special. Below is the example of Sabi.</p>

        <p>This is the picture of the rusted and collapsed boat under blue sky. The bottom part of the boat has been eroded by the water over time, and this erosion makes the boat special. You must be feeling a loneliness and an elapse of a long time. If you find this picture beautiful, that is the sense of beauty “Sabi” suggests.</p>
        <h3>Me (20s)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When you have a guest, what would you serve?</li>
          <p>Cold green tea or Oolong tea</p>

          <li>Is there any other way to use tea leaf than brewing?</li>
          <p>Eat brewed tea leaves with Ponzu sauce, which is soy sauce with vinegar. You can taste the sourness of the sauce after the bitterness of tea leaves. One of my favorite snack.</p>

          <li>How often do you drink green tea/coffee?</li>
          <p>Cold green tea: 1 bottle per day   Coffee: 2 cups per day
          Hot green tea: 1 cup per week</p>

          <li>Any tea-related story?</li>
          <p>I agree with both my grandmother and mother that good restaurants have to serve high quality green tea. Especially, I would not like to go to sushi restaurants which serve poor green tea.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Comparison of 3 generations</h2>

        <p>By comparing the tea culture in 3 generations of 70s, 50s and 20s, we can find interesting similarities and differences.</p>

        <h4>Serving different kind of beverage</h4>
        <p>My grandmother always serves high quality hot green tea to a guest, even if it is the middle of summer. That is not true to my mother and me. My mother serves green tea to a guest, but when the guest is her friend, she may serve hot British tea or coffee. To her, it is reasonable to serve cold drinks when it is summer. When it comes to a younger generation, the case is different. When I have a friend visiting me, I would serve cold beverage such as juice and Oolong tea no matter what the season is. It seems that as the generation gets older, they would serve hot green tea rather than cold beverage.</p>

        <h4>Different ways of utilizing brewed tea leaves</h4>
        <p>Each person has the different ways of exploiting used tea leaves. Utilizing used tea leaves as a fertilizer is my grandmother’s idea. Tea leaves help grow plants because the leaves contains a lot of nutritions. To some kind of plants, tea leaves can be a suitable fertilizer. My mother utilizes tea leaves for cleaning. Tea leaves help her sweep on floors without swirling dust up. My favorite way of utilizing used tea leaves is to eat them with Ponzu, soy sauce mixed with vinegar. I found this way of eating when I was in elementary school and, this is tasty. Japanese people are always looking for ways to utilize used tea leaves and there are a number of ways. Everyone has their favorite way of dealing with used tea leaves.</p>

        <h4>The amount of tea we consume</h4>
        <p>The biggest difference can be seen in how often we drink tea. My grandmother drinks hot green tea the most and has 5 cups per day. As the generation gets younger, we drink less cups of tea. My mother drinks hot green tea and coffee, and I drink one cup of hot green tea per week. Instead of hot green tea, I drink cold green tea and hot coffee. As Chinese people drink hot tea instead of cold tea, my grandmother drinks hot green tea even in summer. She describes that drinking hot green tea gives her an energy. From this comparison, it is sure that the younger people drink less amount of hot green tea compared to the older people.</p>

        <h4>The importance of green tea as a part of meal</h4>
        <p>Even though we have different attitudes toward green tea, we all agreed that good Japanese restaurants should serve high quality green tea. Green tea is one of the fundamental component of Japanese food culture. Good meal starts with a cup of good hot green tea and ends with another cup of good hot green tea.</p>

        <p>Within Japan, tea culture is different in generations. The drink we serve to a guest is different. My grandmother always offers hot green tea, while my mother serves one from hot or cold green tea, Black  tea, or coffee. The youngest of three, I, offers cold beverage such as juice and cold Oolong tea. Interestingly, there are a number of ways to utilize used tea leaves and no matter what the generation is, everyone has their favorite way of utilizing used tea leaves. The greatest difference is the amount of green tea we drink. My grandmother drinks the most, and as the generation gets younger, we drink less amount of hot green tea. Different from my grandmother and mother, I drink more of coffee and cold green tea than hot green tea. Even though each generation has different way of looking at green tea, green tea is one of the most important Japanese culture for every generation. The requirement of a nice restaurant is to serve high quality green tea; this shows the importance of tea culture in Japan and Japanese food culture.</p>
